# BERT-Gutenberg-Analysis

A Gutenberg Text Annotation Analysis project for my INFO 159 final project at UC Berkeley.

## About
Utilized BERT to predict the age range of English-language Gutenberg texts as primary (ages 9-12), secondary (ages 13-16), or tertiary (ages 17+). Our final model achieved 60% accuracy with a 95% confidence interval of [0.532, 0.668].

## Results
Please refer to our [AP4 Analysis](https://github.com/amelialwx/BERT-Gutenberg-Analysis/blob/main/AP4%20Analysis.pdf) for our analysis. PDF of Jupyter Notebook code with results can be found [here](https://github.com/amelialwx/BERT-Gutenberg-Analysis/blob/main/INFO%20159%20Final%20Project.pdf).
