# BERT-Gutenberg-Analysis

A Gutenberg Text Annotation Analysis project for my INFO 159 final project at UC Berkeley.

## About
Used BERT to predict if a Gutenberg text is meant for primary (ages 9-12), secondary (ages 13-16), or tertiery (ages 17+) students. Texts are filtered to contain only English documents. Our final BERT model achieved an accuracy of 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.532, 0.668].

## Results
Please refer to our ![AP4 Analysis](https://github.com/amelialwx/BERT-Gutenberg-Analysis/blob/main/AP4%20Analysis.pdf) for our analysis. PDF of Jupyter Notebook code with results can be found ![here](https://github.com/amelialwx/BERT-Gutenberg-Analysis/blob/main/INFO%20159%20Final%20Project.pdf)
